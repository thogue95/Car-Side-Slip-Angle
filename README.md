Side Slip Angle Overlay
Update: Cleaned up random values and colors while in the pits.  Removing first version.

Here is a Car Side Slip Angle Overlay to give you an idea of out aggressive your car is taking the turn.  You will find that you probably want to lift off the gas when it turns red.  The color is a gradient from green to red, so ideally you want to be in the yellowish to orange in your turns. I explain the Car Side Slip in great detail in the MoTec V8.0 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MigyRSuNbB8
